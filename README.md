dotfiles

My personnal config files.

**As for now, this does not fully work. Since I use some git projects
within my configuration and that I might be a bit retarded, I could
not manage it properly.** 

*I'm really sorry, this will come soon*

Disclaimer
----------
This repository contains my personnal config files for various applications.
This is first and foremost designed for my own needs (backup / bootstrapping
from various places).
If you want to try it out, just clone this repo and run bootstrap.sh.
This will not override your previous configuration : the script will
ask you if you want to keep your own file for every items. I greatly
recommand to save any previous work though if you just intend to test my
configuration.

I might integrate a backup handler to automatize the process (backup / restore).
This is not a priority though and this has great chance not to come
any time soon.

Supported applications
----------------------
- awesome
- ranger
- vim
- moc
- luakit
- xfce4-terminal (Terminal)

Some might be added, depending on my personnal needs.


Remark
------
/!\ You will need powerline (https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline) for
the vimrc file to be fully operationnal. (if you don't need it,
just tweak a bit the file in order to get the old status bar displayed).

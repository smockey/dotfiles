My personnal config files.

## Disclaimer

This repository contains my personnal config files for various applications.
This is first and foremost designed for my own needs (backup / bootstrapping
from various places).
If you want to try it out, just clone this repo and run install.sh.
This will not override your previous configuration : the script will
ask you if you want to keep your own file for every items.

That being said, I greatly recommand to save any previous work though if you
just intend to test my configuration.

## Goals

- Maintain a coherent config backup / bootstrap
- Provide support for b√©po (french dvorak variant, more about it [here](http://bepo.fr/wiki/Accueil))
- Provide uniformized [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color scheme for various applications
